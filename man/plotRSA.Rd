\item{xy2}{XY^2 coefficient}

\item{x2y}{X^2Y coefficient}

\item{y3}{Y^3 coefficient}

\item{b0}{Intercept}

\item{type}{\code{3d} for 3d surface plot, \code{contour} for 2d contour plot, "interactive" for interactive rotatable plot. Shortcuts (i.e., first letter of string) are sufficient}

\item{ylab}{Label for y axis}

\item{zlab}{Label for z axis}

\item{main}{the main title of the plot}

\item{surface}{Method for the calculation of the surface z values. "predict" takes the predicted values from the model, "smooth" uses a thin plate smoother (function \code{Tps} from the \code{fields} package) of the raw data}

\item{lambda}{lambda parameter for the smoother. Default (NULL) means that it is estimated by the smoother function. Small lambdas around 1 lead to rugged surfaces, big lambdas to very smooth surfaces.}

\item{suppress.surface}{Should the surface be suppressed (only for \code{type="3d"})? Useful for only showing the data points, or for didactic purposes (e.g., first show the cube, then fade in the surface).}

\item{suppress.box}{Should the surrounding box be suppressed (only for \code{type="3d"})?}

\item{rotation}{Rotation of the 3d surface plot (when type == "3d")}

\item{label.rotation}{Rotation of the axis labls (when type == "3d")}

\item{gridsize}{Number of grid nodes in each dimension}

\item{bw}{Print surface in black and white instead of colors?}

\item{legend}{Print color legend for z values?}

\item{param}{Should the surface parameters a1 to a4 be shown on the plot? In case of a 3d plot a1 to a4 are printed on top of the plot; in case of a contour plot the principal axes are plotted.}

\item{coefs}{Should the regression coefficients b1 to b5 be shown on the plot? (Only for 3d plot)}

\item{control.variables}{Should the control variables be shown on the plot? (Only for 3d plot)}

\item{axes}{A vector of strings specifying the axes that should be plotted. Can be any combination of c("LOC", "LOIC", "PA1", "PA2"). LOC = line of congruence, LOIC = line of incongruence, PA1 = first principal axis, PA2 = second principal axis}

\item{project}{A vector of graphic elements that should be projected on the floor of the cube. Can include any combination of c("LOC", "LOIC", "PA1", "PA2", "contour", "points")}

\item{maxlines}{Should the maximum lines be plotted? (red: maximum X for a given Y, blue: maximum Y for a given X). Works only in type="3d"}

\item{cex}{Font size factor for axes labels and axes titles}

\item{cex.main}{Factor for main title size}

\item{points}{A list of parameters which define the appearance of the raw scatter points: 
\itemize{
    \item data: Data frame which contains the coordinates of the raw data points. First column = x, second = y, third = z. This data frame is automatically generated when the plot is based on a fitted RSA-object
    \item show = TRUE: Should the original data points be overplotted?
    \item color = "black": Color of the points
        \item value="raw": Plot the original z value, "predicted": plot the predicted z value
    \item jitter = 0: Amount of jitter for the raw data points. For z values, a value of 0.005 is reasonable
    \item cex = .5: multiplication factor for point size
        \item out.mark = FALSE: If set to TRUE, outliers according to Bollen & Jackman (1980) are printed as red X symbols, but only when they have been removed in the RSA function: \code{RSA(..., out.rm=TRUE)}.
        \itemize{
            \item If out.rm == TRUE (in RSA()) and out.mark == FALSE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is removed from the model and *not plotted* in plotRSA.
            \item If out.rm == TRUE (in RSA()) and out.mark == TRUE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is removed from the model but plotted and marked in plotRSA.
            \item If out.rm == FALSE (in RSA()): Outliers are not removed and cannot be plotted.
            \item Example syntax: \code{plotRSA(r1, points=list(show=TRUE, out.mark=TRUE))}
    }
}
As a shortcut, you can also set \code{points=TRUE} to set the defaults.}

\item{fit}{Do not change that parameter (internal use only)}

\item{link}{Link function to transform the z axes. Implemented are "identity" (no transformation; default), "probit", and "logit"}

\item{tck}{A vector of three values defining the position of labels to the axes (see ?wireframe)}

\item{distance}{A vector of three values defining the distance of labels to the axes}

\item{border}{Should a thicker border around the surface be plotted? Sometimes this border leaves the surrounding box, which does not look good. In this case the border can be suppressed by setting \code{border=FALSE}.}

\item{contour}{A list defining the appearance of contour lines (aka. height lines). show=TRUE: Should the contour lines be plotted on the 3d wireframe plot? (Parameter only relevant for \code{type="3d"}). color = "grey40": Color of the contour lines. highlight = c(): A vector of heights which should be highlighted (i.e., printed in bold). Be careful: the highlighted line is not necessarily exactly at the specified height; instead the nearest height line is selected.}

\item{hull}{Plot a bag plot on the surface (This is a bivariate extension of the boxplot. 50\% of points are in the inner bag, 50\% in the outer region). See Rousseeuw, Ruts, & Tukey (1999).}

\item{showSP}{Plot the stationary point? (only relevant for \code{type="contour"})}

\item{showSP.CI}{Plot the CI of the stationary point? (only relevant for \code{type="contour"})}

\item{pal}{A palette for shading. You can use \code{\link{colorRampPalette}} to construct a color ramp, e.g. \code{plot(r.m, pal=colorRampPalette(c("darkgreen", "yellow", "darkred"))(20))}. If \code{pal="flip"}, the default palette is used, but reversed (so that red is on top and green on the bottom).}

\item{pal.range}{Should the color range be scaled to the box (\code{pal.range = "box"}, default), or to the min and max of the surface (\code{pal.range = "surface"})? If set to "box", different surface plots can be compared along their color, as long as the zlim is the same for both.}

\item{pad}{Pad controls the margin around the figure (positive numbers: larger margin, negative numbers: smaller margin)}

\item{demo}{Do not change that parameter (internal use only)}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to the plotting function (e.g., sub="Title"). A useful title might be the R squared of the plotted model: \code{sub = as.expression(bquote(R^2==.(round(getPar(x, "r2", model="full"), 3))))}}

\description{
Plots an RSA object, or a response surface with specified parameters
}
\details{
Each plot type has its distinctive advantages. The two-dimensional contour plot gives a clear view of the position of the principal axes and the stationary point. The 3d plot gives a three dimensional impression of the surface, allows overplotting of the original data points (in case an RSA object is provided), and allows the interactive adjustment of regression weights in the \code{\link{RSA}} function. The interactive plot allows rotating and exploring a three-dimensional surface with the mouse (nice for demonstration purposes).
If you want to export publication-ready plots, it is recommended to export it with following commands:
\code{p1 <- plot(r1, bw=TRUE)
trellis.device(device="cairo_pdf", filename="RSA_plot.pdf")
print(p1)
dev.off()}
}
